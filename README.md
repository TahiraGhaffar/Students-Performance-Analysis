This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a student performance dataset obtained from Kaggle. The objective of the analysis is to identify key academic and behavioral factors influencing students' final scores and to derive meaningful insights through data preprocessing and visualization.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Python.

The following preprocessing steps were performed:
Standardized column names (lowercase, removed spaces)
Handled missing numeric values using median imputation
Filled missing categorical values using mode
Normalized categorical values (e.g., Yes/No → 1/0)
Validated data types for modeling

Key Insights
Attendance showed strong positive correlation with final scores
Study hours had moderate positive correlation
Students with internet access showed slightly higher performance trends
